This project challenged me in ways that were mostly unrelated to the code itself. I first incorrectly linked my project to git hub, so I was unable to add my code from the terminal. Once I noticed this, I struggled to find a way to link my existing file to the odin-recipes repo on git hub. Instead of fixing the mistake in this project, I instead uploaded the files locally into the repo. I will learn from this mistake in the future by making sure the project is linked correctly to git hub before beginning any work. I had little problem with the code itself. The mistakes I made involved accidental extra characters in the code that were quickly found and fixed. Another mistake I made was capitalizing my file names, which I will pay extra attention to in the future. Thus project has been a rewarding, fun, and useful expedition. I now know that I have much less knowledge on the interworking of git hub than I first believed, which is something I must remedy.
